# picoCTF-2025

First-time participant in the 2025 PicoCTF competition, where I gained hands-on experience tackling a variety of cybersecurity challenges, including:

- Binary Exploitation: Analyzed source code to identify vulnerabilities, used Ghidra and format string vulnerabilities to find memory addresses on the server-side client, and performed attacks based on these findings.
- Reverse Engineering: Examined source code to discover vulnerabilities and applied various techniques to exploit them.
- Forensics: Investigated Event Viewer logs and Wireshark network packet captures, and used Zsteg to analyze data in forensic challenges.
- Web Exploitation: Used the Metasploit Framework to exploit web application vulnerabilities and achieve remote code execution.
- Cryptography: Cracked hashes using John the Ripper to solve cryptographic challenges.

Tools & Techniques Used:
Ghidra, Binwalk, John the Ripper, Zsteg, Event Viewer, Wireshark, Metasploit Framework, and others.

This experience expanded my technical skill set, deepened my understanding of attack/defense strategies, and sparked a continued interest in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and cybersecurity.
